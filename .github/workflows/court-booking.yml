          Hi team,

          I've just attempted to book the courts for you. Here's what I managed to do:

          Booking Details:
          ----------------
          ${{ env.BOOKING_RESULTS }}

          Remember: If you need to cancel or change any bookings, you'll need to do that through the Telford Park Tennis Club website.

          Best regards,
          Dan's Offshore Booking Team
